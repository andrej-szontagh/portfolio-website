TODO:   figure out hosting !!!
        Use GitHUB .. just create repository "<name-of-repository>.github.io"
        Download their app. Then using the full name of the repository as website URL.

        The question is .. do we use separate repository for source and dist or somehow
        use one repository for both while not making a complete mess ?

        Google out how we should set up the files for a website and how for a webside dev. project

BUG:    MOBILE HOVER :

        to hover you have to touch the button but when touching the screen to hide the overlay you actually touch
        element below and trigger image lightbox (for example).

        We need to test this with actual phone !

        TODO:   check all responsivity once again before release ..




TODO:   add some animations for : email banner, terms & conditions text, copyright text ..

TODO:   It's not always obvious that you should scroll (at some dimensions) when showing terms & conditions !


TODO:   NEVER use OR REDUCE 'em' or 'rem' !!! .. except obvious text settings especially,
        not for margins or media queries !!

TODO:   remove $font-size-factor-down / up .. it's BS, may not work well every time since the
        bounding box doesn't necessary scale linearly with text size.

TODO:   remove CSS variables (unless absolutely necessary) use SASS variables they are more powerful and doesn't imply
        that you can change them on the fly which would break the design in most cases
        change font-sizes to SASS variables

TODO:   remove device targeting media breakpoints ! .. they are useless !

TODO:   make sure UI elements are in the GRID !

TODO:   figure out how to actually use VUE in our website :)

TODO:   test videos on actual phone to see how the video playback works !

TODO:   handle mobile videos !! .. it plays too many videos at the same time
        maybe one video at a time would be the best ..
        test mobile with bandwith restriction to see how it looks like when videos are
        buffering all the time or during playback

IDEA:   add video/loading progress bar as a thin white line under the video container
        filling from the left to right

TODO:   test the website with bandwidth trottle
TODO:   test on all browsers + your phone !

TODO:   lazy loading of images (loads low-res tumbnails super fast and then load full-res images asynchronously)

IDEA:   http://htmlgl.com/ ??
